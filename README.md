# Permutations
The formula for permutations with repetition is:

Permutations=n\r
example: 2008
Where:
n is the number of options (in this case, the number of unique digits, which is 3: 2,,0 and 8)
r is the number of positions (in this case, the number of digits in the four-digit number, which is 4)

meaning the result are: 3^4 = 81

Therefore, there are 81 possible four-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 2, 0, 0, and 8, allowing repetition of digits.
